## Changes:
- Changed the audio file to never gonna give you up by Rick Astley.
- Moved the mute/unmute button up so it would appear on screen.

## Note:
- I recognize, not actually a Rick Roll if you know it is happening beforehand, but it was a clear name for what one of the major changes was.
- Also, reminder to play audio, click on the volume bar (setting it to any point(loud enough to hear), and the audio will start)
